# GenerateCodeFromSQLDDLPluginForIDEA
My poor plugin collections

- You can use this plugin for generating code from different sources like SqlDDL or JSON, but now, this version can only generate from SqlDDL.<br>
- Just select the row you want to generate, and press ALT + G.
- You don't have to select all the text, just make sure that you select the row like using ALT + /.
- Now, only support for few type of mysql.
